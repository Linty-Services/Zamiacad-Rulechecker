The goal of this file is to configure the RuleChecker with various location and files.
It is created by the RC HMI when a new project is created.
To be compliant to both Linux and Windows environments, all folders and files paths are relative to the project folder using Linux notation.
Note for Windows users: in case the Handbook folder is not in the same drive than the VHDL project, the path is kept absolute.
The file can be manually edited if necessary.
